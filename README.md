# 👋 Hey there!

I’m a self-taught developer working my way into tech while running a small painting business.  
🐍 Python is my main tool, but I’m picking up C, Go, and whatever else I need to build cool things.  
🧪 I get excited about everything from media systems to game development to CLI tools.  
🚧 Still early in my journey, but I'm serious about building, learning, and leveling up.  
🤝 Always happy to connect, share, or swap project ideas.
